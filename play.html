        <h3> SECOND ACT _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_ </h3>
        
        <h4> LORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  I wonder </h4>

        <h5> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife
             knows nothing.
            <br>
            LORD GORING.  [_Strongly_.]  Oh, fight in any case—in any case.
            <br>
            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  If my wife found
            out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear
            from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a
            chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own
            weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she
            looks like a woman with a past, doesn’t she?
            <br>
            LORD GORING.  Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just
            as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley’s past is merely
            a slightly décolleté one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
            Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening
            Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be
            easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows
            wonderful presence of mind.
            <br>
            SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every chance.
            I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my feet,
            and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife’s voice.
            <br>
            [_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN _in walking dress_.]
            
            LADY CHILTERN.  Good afternoon, Lord Goring!
            <br>
            LORD GORING.  Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the Park?
            <br>
            LADY CHILTERN.  No; I have just come from the Woman’s Liberal
            Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud
            applause, and now I have come in to have my tea.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]
            You will wait and have some tea, won’t you?
            <br>
            LORD GORING.  I’ll wait for a short time, thanks.
         </h5>
