        <h3> SECOND ACT _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_ </h3>

        <p> <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>  
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Smiling_.]</p>  
            <p class="speech LORD GORING">I wonder </p>

            <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> 
            <p class="speech SIR ROBERT CHILTERN"> I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife
             knows nothing.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>  
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Strongly_.]</p> 
             <p class="speech LORD GORING">Oh, fight in any case—in any case.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>  
            <p class="stage-direction">[_With a gesture of despair_.]</p> 
            <p class="speech SIR ROBERT CHILTERN">If my wife found
            out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear
            from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a
            chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own
            weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she
            looks like a woman with a past, doesn’t she?</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LORD GORING></h6> 
            <p class="speech LORD GORING">Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just
            as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley’s past is merely
            a slightly décolleté one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
            Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening
            Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be
            easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows
            wonderful presence of mind.</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6> 
            <p class="speech SIR ROBERT CHILTERN">Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every chance.
            I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my feet,
            and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife’s voice.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN _in walking dress_.]</p>
            
            <h6 class="name">LADY CHILTERN</h6> 
            <p class="speech LADY CHILTERN">Good afternoon, Lord Goring!</p>
    
            <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>  
            <p class="speech LORD GORING">Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the Park?</p>
    
            <h6 class="name">LADY CHILTERN</h6> 
            <p class="speech LADY CHILTERN">No; I have just come from the Woman’s Liberal
            Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud
            applause, and now I have come in to have my tea.</p> 
            <p class="stage-direction"> [_To_ LORD GORING.]</p>
            <p class="speech LORD GORING">You will wait and have some tea, won’t you?</p>

            <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6> 
            <p class="speech LORD GORING"> I’ll wait for a short time, thanks.</p>
